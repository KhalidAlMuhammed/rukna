## 🔥 Hackathon Hacks

### Time-Saving Tips
1. **Use Supabase Auth UI**: Don't build login forms from scratch
2. **Mock Complex Features**: Payments, notifications, file uploads
3. **Focus on Core Demo**: AI matching is your differentiator
4. **Prepare Fallbacks**: If AI fails, have manual matching
5. **Use Component Libraries**: Headless UI, Radix UI
6. **Deploy Early**: Get it online by hour 12

### Common Pitfalls
- Don't over-engineer the database
- Don't spend too much time on styling early
- Don't try to build everything perfectly
- Don't ignore mobile responsiveness
- Don't forget to test the demo flow

### Emergency Backup Plans
- **AI API Fails**: Use keyword matching
- **Database Issues**: Use local JSON files
- **Styling Problems**: Use default Tailwind
- **Deployment Issues**: Use Vercel preview URLs

## ⚠️ Hackathon Risks & Mitigation

### Technical Risks
1. **AI API Limits/Failures**
   - **Backup**: Simple keyword matching
   - **Test Early**: Verify API works in first 2 hours

2. **Supabase Issues**
   - **Backup**: Local JSON data for demo
   - **Prevention**: Use Supabase templates

3. **Deployment Problems**
   - **Backup**: Run demo locally
   - **Prevention**: Deploy early and often

### Time Management Risks
1. **Feature Creep**
   - **Solution**: Stick to MVP features only
   - **Focus**: AI matching + booking flow

2. **Perfect Code Syndrome**
   - **Solution**: Make it work first, optimize never
   - **Mindset**: Demo > Clean Code

3. **Last-Minute Bugs**
   - **Solution**: Stop coding 2 hours before demo
   - **Buffer**: Use final hours for testing only
